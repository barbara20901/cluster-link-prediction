# cluster-link-prediction
This repository provides some of the code implemented and the data used for the work proposed in "A Cluster-Based Trip Prediction Graph Neural Network Model for Bike Sharing Systems".

The datasets can be found in:
* CitiBike Historical Trips - https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data
* Weather - https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=NY_ASOS
* Station Status - https://www.theopenbus.com/raw-data.html
* Geographical Distances - https://openrouteservice.org/ (the distances extracted from the ORS API are also available in the "Data" folder of this repository)
